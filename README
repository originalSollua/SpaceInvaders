Space invaders

A Java based space invaders game.

Java based graphics ahve always been a little mystifying to me, so on a whim, this semester I diceide to implement a game using Java to try and develop those skills a bit. 
To that end, I located a tutorial for space invaders online to get a handle on the basic graphic opperations. 
Once the base game was implemented, I began to expand it. 
I added powerups first, which changes your weapon's behavior based on your score. 
Currently, a basic weapon, double shot, and missle weapon are implemented. 

Next, I modified the aliens to fire back. Each alien fires based on its won internal offsets, randomly generated on their creation. 

Finally, I added a shields system, so that taking damage is no longer an instant game over. 
The shield bar collor grows more red based on how much shield you have left. Red = low shield strength

Planned features:
        more powerups
        powerups drop from destroyed aliens
        change to level layout:
            instead of spawning in blocks of aliens, waves are spawned with 3 - 5 aliens each
            aliens then have health, and more complex behaviors
            levels culminate in a large boss
        add backround texture to the levesl
        make background texture scroll
        develop level loader to build levels upon game start
        implement UI to tidy up some of the clunky elements such as text and shields
        between - mission UI to select "flavor" of mission  - diferent muissions have different rewards and risks

Useage:  
            java gameManager
